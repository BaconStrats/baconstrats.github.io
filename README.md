### Mission Statement

We believe in a open source community, where contracts are open for public viewing and auditing.  Governance will be driven by proof of ownership, and will driven by the community. Our goal is to not replace the standards of crypto, but have a community alternative to hold value and build the metaverse as they want.  

As our roadmap shows, we plan to grow the project team from the community where not only you have an opportunity to govern through ownership, but execute the changes the community desires.
