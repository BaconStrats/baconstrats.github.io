## Welcome
The community is happy you landed here. BaconStrats' Meta Bacon is designed to be a community funded metaverse.  Where being a diamond hand hodl'r will allow you drive the creation of games, nft's, future contracts, and in the future - board members.  The first requirement to being a community steward is being doxed.  There is anomity when building a community of like minded hodl'ers.

### Mission Statement

We believe in a open source community, where contracts are open for public viewing and auditing.  Governance will be driven by proof of ownership, and will be driven by the community. Our goal is to not replace the standards of crypto, but have a community alternative to hold value and build the metaverse they want.  

As our roadmap will show, we plan to grow the project team from the community. Where not only you have an opportunity to govern through ownership, but execute the changes the community desires.

### Tokenomics

We are a US based crypto project, and we believe in having multiple sovereign currencies, where the people can determine the value of A currency.  Back to the frontier days, where two people agree on the value of a service. And with every true currency in mankind, it was backed by an commodity.  Not the federal reserve's answer of printing more.  Currency should be a dieing supply.  And with the crypto revolution, we can hard code the absolute value and fair game restrictions. 

Just like every natural resource in hunan history, supplies deplete overtime, and so will the BACONBITS ($BBTS) coin.
