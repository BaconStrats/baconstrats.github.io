## Welcome
The community is happy you landed here. BaconStrats' Meta Bacon is designed to be a community funded metaverse.  Where being a diamond hand hodl'r will allow you to drive the creation of games, nft's, future contracts, and in the future - board members.  The first requirement to being a community steward is being doxed.  There is no anonymity when building a community of like minded hodl'ers.

### Mission Statement

We believe in a open source community, where contracts are open for public viewing and auditing.  Governance will be driven by proof of ownership, and will be driven by the community. Our goal is to not replace the standards of crypto, but have a community alternative to hold value and build the metaverse they want.  

As our roadmap will show, we plan to grow the project team from the community. Where not only you have an opportunity to govern through ownership, but execute the changes the community desires. 

### White Paper

The white paper has been hosted on medium, including any project and community updates.

### Tokenomics

We are a US based crypto project, and we believe in having multiple sovereign currencies, where the people can determine the value of A currency.  Back to the frontier days, where two people agree on the value of a service. And with every true currency in mankind, it was backed by an commodity.  Not the federal reserve's answer of printing more.  Currency should be a dieing supply.  And with the crypto revolution, we can hard code the absolute value and fair game restrictions. 

Just like every natural resource in human history, supplies deplete overtime, and so will the [TBA] coin.

### Distribution
This project must have a pre-sale to succeed. We need like minded people who want to build the next community crypto.  An investment has been made by the project team, therefore,three percent (3%) of the total supply has been allocated to them. These funds will be split up evenly by the three team members, and are escrowed into the managing partner's address.  

With the desired services the Meta Bacon hopes to serve, an initial five percent (5%) has been taken to bring on future ambassadors.
